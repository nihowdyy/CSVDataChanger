# CSVDataChanger
Hi, this application was created by Gavin Li during his Winter 2020 Co-op Term.
In order to use this application, ensure that you have a .csv file that is formatted
correctly. 
While using this program, it might say that a "string was not recognized as a valid datetime".
This occurs due to the date being formatted incorrectly. So in order to fix that.
1. Ensure that the program has the time formatted to MM/dd/yyyy.
2. Ensure that the columns of the .csv that include times are formatted to MM/dd/yyyy.
(This can be done by highlighting the entire column and selecting "date").
3. Save the .csv file, and re-run the program.

Additionally, before use, remember to close the file being converted, as it will show up as
an error otherwise.

INSTRUCTIONS TO USE THE APPLICATION:
1. Select the ... button that is next to the File text box in order to select the file being converted
in order to select the file that is being converted.
2. Select the ... button that is next to the Save to: text box in order to name the file that will contain
all the converted information.
3. Press start in order to start the application.

For any further inquiries, you can contact me.
